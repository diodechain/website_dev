hero-description: <span class="company-name">Diode<span>TM</span></span> lets you retain the security and privacy of a local area network while enabling the convenience of remote accessibility - all without IT admins.














about-title: Look mum, no server!
about-description: >-
    The Diode P2P network allows any device on the planet to directly serve secured content to the public Internet. 
    We're ending the monopoly of datacenter servers and the need for static IP addresses. With Diode, your Ethereum
    address is your static address, and, with ENS (Ethereum Name System) and BNS (Blockchain Name System), your content
    can be accessed with a human-readable names.

features-title: What can Diode do for You?
features-description: Here are some example use cases of a decentralized P2P network. To learn more about the technical foundations, check the docs.
features:

    ### Feature 1
    - title: Publish your Raspberry Pi Webcam to the Internet
      description: >-
        See above for a step-by-step guide for how to publish your Raspberry PI on the Diode P2P network. The
        example uses Diode shared streams to broadcast the video stream through the P2P network, and supports many 
        simultaneous viewers.  

        Check out our demo streams at https://betahaus-berlin.diode.link and https://pi-taipei.diode.link, and open 
        multiple browser windows at once so see the shared streams in action. <blockquote>curl -Ssf https://diode.io/install.sh | sh</blockquote>

    ### Feature 2
    - title: SSH into your Devices from Anywhere
      description: >-
        Instead of using centralized servers with static IP addresses or DynDNS, you can use the static Ethereum
        Addresses with the Diode P2P network to setup a reliable virtual private network around the globe. All 
        existing TCP based applications are compatible with the Diode P2P network, and can be streamed through it.
        To try this out, install the Diode P2P Client and tunnel your SSH connection to any other device on the Diode P2P
        network: <blockquote>ssh pi@pi-taipei.diode -o 'ProxyCommand=nc -X 5 -x localhost:1080 %h %p'</blockquote>

    ### Feature 3
    - title: Share Your Network with Your Friends
      description: >-
        Define a Diode Fleet to which only your invited Friends have access. You're creating an invite-only
        private network over the Internet. You and your Friends can exclusively use this network for all types 
        of secure digital traffic - whether that be file sharing, secure communications, or streaming private content.
        Since all communication is E2E encrypted using Ethereum Addresses for authentication, no one can get in the middle
        of your conversations.
