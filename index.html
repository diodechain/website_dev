  ### Feature 1
  - title: Remote Work
    description: >-
      Diode is a great choice for businesses and individuals who want to keep their files on their local systems, but need to unlock the efficiencies that come with remote access.  Files are stored on your hard-drive, but can be shared with employees, partners, and customers as easily as cloud-based solutions.  Both native file synchronization and web-based sharing are supported, and permissions can be managed at a granular level.

  ### Feature 2
  - title: Data Sovereignity
    description: >-
      For too long, people have been trading privacy and data sovereignity for convenience, often against their better judgement!  Diodeâ€™s technologies enable every person and every business to reclaim sovereignity over their information, while also enabling all of the efficiency and access improvements that come with cloud-first storage solutions.  Our serverless technology retains compliance with your existing regulatory regime, and does not require IT support to maintain.

  ### Feature 3
  - title: No IT Administration
    description: >-
      Other solutions require you to implement complicated IT technologies to manage sharing, or force you to use centrally managed servers that often have questionable privacy policies.  These alternatives require you to choose the lesser of two evils - a brittle, complicated, and costly IT system or a simpler system that requires undue trust in a third party vendor.  Both of these bad alternatives introduce points of vulnerability.  Diode brings the best of both worlds - our servers are fully trustless and open source, eliminating attack vectors and proving the security of your valuable data.
