[Slack](https://slack.com/pricing) has recently changed its pricing to require a subscription to a paid plan to retain access to older messages - this change has motivated a lot of people to look for a free Slack alternative.

Read below for how [Diode Drive](https://diode.io/products/d-ddrive) can not only be used a free Slack alternative, but also as a more secure and capable environment for individuals and teams!

# What Features are Important in a Free Slack Alternative?

Chat has become an indispensable tool for work and personal communications.  Some key features that make or break a chat application are simple!  Let’s dig in.

## Inherently Secure and Private
One of the most important factors is the security of your chat app.  No-one wants their communications, personal information, or friend network to be used in a way they don’t intend. People’s frustrations with their data becoming someone else’s product has meant that chat application security has become the number one determining factor in chat application adoption:

At the core of this problem is that, for most chat applications, your information resides on a server that the chat company runs.  It is a rare organization (like Diode and like Signal!) who has made a fundamental commitment that your information is not even accessible to them.

Diode takes this two steps further - Diode accounts are pseudo anonymous (they have a username, but require no identifiable information) and they use self custodial authentication (your account information is not stored on any server where it could be subject to a data breach).  Apps like Slack,  Discord, and even Signal require other account identifiers and store certain authentication information on managed servers.  

## Designed for Team Collaborations

We really respect Signal here at Diode.  However, Signal is oriented towards individual users and user groups - not towards teams.

Diode is more team-oriented, like Slack or Discord, and also has native integrations with structured files (a self custody Dropbox / Google Drive like capability) and dynamic content (an enterprise VPN like capability) - the very information that makes many chats pertinent to teams in the first place!

If the team's focus includes files/work product, Diode Drive can help the team's chats organize, share, reference, pin, and even author files in conversations.  

If the team's core focus includes accessing secure dynamic content - like access to a server admin interface or training content - those resources can be accessed end-to-end encrypted from within the app, making the insitu team collaboration more pertinent and accessible.

## Never Holds Your Data Hostage
Most chat apps have to restrict storage / history in their free plans so that their "freebie" cloud server bill can be controlled.  This means that teams need to use higher priced plans when they need more storage or longer history.  For example, if you need more than 90 days of chat history with Slack, you need to pay a minimum of $7.25 USD per team member for that privelege.

Diode is a self-custody solution - we have no cloud server bills related to storage and chat history - your team's devices act as a "self custody bit torrent" to supply and maintain the full context of your organizations chat history overtime - regardless of message or content size.
