[Diode Drive](https://diode.io/products/d-drive/) is a secure and confidential decentralized alternative to Dropbox.  

[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) is an online service that offers you cloud storage space for your files, and allows you to easily share the files with others.  Dropbox is a traditional web service - cloud servers are at the center of the service, and are responsible for storing your files and managing access to them.  A growing number of individuals and organizations are becoming aware of [the security challenges](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach) of this model, and are looking for a more secure and confidential alternative to Dropbox.  

Diode Drive is a secure and decentralized [information self-custody](https://diode.io/diode%20drive/self-custody-for-data-22032/) solution.  Although Diode Drive has many of the same capabilities as Dropbox, Diode Drive users have full control of who has access to their information and where the information is stored.  This revolutionizes the ability to deploy a secure information program without custom IT development or maintenance (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, cross-geopolitical security).

The topics below detail why Diode Drive can be a more secure, confidential, and affordable decentralized alternative to Dropbox.

# Diode Drive as a Decentralized Dropbox Alternative

## 1) Storage Cost

Dropbox has a [number of plans](https://dropbox.com/plans), including a basic free plan that has up to 2GB of storage.  The highest plan has unlimited storage, and costs $20/user/month.

Diode Drive has [no fees for storage size](https://support.diode.io/article/vr156n18cf-is-diodedrive-unlimited-storage) – you can store as much data as your devices can handle for free.

## 2) Data Confidentiality

Dropbox stores all your data on their servers – they have full access to your information.  While Dropbox’s [privacy policy](https://www.dropbox.com/privacy) may or may not reassure you that Dropbox will not use your information in a way you do not expect, organizations such as Dropbox are daily subject to information requests from the relevant authorities in the regions in which they operate.  Sometimes these information requests include requests for data stored by account holders.

Diode Drive, on the other hand, has no servers that store your data, and file transfers and communications are end-to-end encrypted.  Therefore, Diode can’t access your information in ways you do not expect, regardless of the reason.

## 3) Account Security

As with all web services, Dropbox can email you a “reset password” link to enable you to regain access to your account.  However, server-based account credentials, and other customer or product support features intended to help you, can sometimes be used to [compromise your account](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach).

Diode Drive accounts use a [Backup Code](https://support.diode.io/article/l7noragxyj-diode-drive-backup-codes) approach that enables a fully decentralized method of account security.  Not only is Diode unable to reset the credentials for your account, no one at Diode can use a backdoor to gain access to your account or data. (Note: this also means that your Backup Code should be stored in a safe place!)

## 4) Personal Information

Although lighter in this area than many web services, Dropbox requires a valid email address, and requests your first and last name.  

Diode Drive is committed to your right to keep your identity separate from your online activity.  The only thing that Diode Drive requires is for you to pick a username of 8 characters or more.  Additionally, you can set a “Nickname” that only your other Team Members can see.

## 5)	Data Storage Locations

Dropbox stores your information on their [cloud servers](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/physical-location-data-storage) which are located in a limited number of regions and have restrictions on data migration.

Diode Drive is a [self-custody solution](https://diode.io/diode%20drive/self-custody-for-data-22032/) – your information is stored at the locations of your Zone’s Team Members – no additional data footprint is created.  You can choose to locate a Team Member (including backup devices) in any region or specific location you wish.  Also, you have the flexibility of including cloud based servers (for faster access) or limiting the Zone to just the devices and IT assets that comply with your information security goals.  

Further, since Diode Drive connection routing uses a decentralized network, the information in the Diode Drive Zone can be accessed securely by Team Members from any part of the world.

## 6)	Direct Connections

The Dropbox cloud servers are always [in the middle of synchronizing files](https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/sync-uploads/sync-overview) between Dropbox team users.  Even if other team users are in the same room, updates to files are first sent to the cloud and then to the other users.

Diode Drive has a [Direct Connect](https://diode.io/diodedrive/diodedriveupdate-directconnect-22033/) feature that can discover other Team Members who are directly accessible – as is often the case, for example, when working together in the same office.  File updates, chats, and other communications are transferred directly from one device to the other for directly connected team members, without requiring additional network routing.  This means file transfers and communications can be much faster, Internet bandwidth usage is reduced, and the footprint of encrypted traffic is minimized.

Diode Drive’s file synchronization behaviour can be pictured as a self-custody bit torrent - Diode Drive Team Members can all provide parts of a file to a Team Member who is out of date.  This allows updates to be streamed from many locations at once, with the result that the receiving Team Member’s device (speed, connection) is often the limiting factor (and not the speed or accessibility of a server).  

## 7)	End to End Encryption

Dropbox uses user-to-server encryption for transferring files.  The server always terminates the encryption. 

Diode uses [user-to-user encryption (end to end encryption)](https://support.diode.io/article/pvmzyqlesq-how-it-works) for transferring files, chat, and other communications.  This removes a number of attack vectors that can be used to gain access to your information, communications, and team members.

## 8)	Share Without the App

Dropbox allows you to share a file to someone who does not have Dropbox installed via shared link.  To do this, you must upload the file to Dropbox servers and send the person the https://www.dropbox.com/ -based link to the file.

Diode Drive allows you to [share a link to a file without first uploading to the cloud](https://diode.io/diode%20drive/Share-Files-Without-Uploading-21077/).  Further, Diode Drive allows you to customize the file sharing page with your [custom organization name and logo](https://support.diode.io/article/ssnzo09rzv-share-page-information).
