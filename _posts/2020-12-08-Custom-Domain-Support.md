In an important step for evolving Web2.0 to Web3, Diode has released the ability to [map a Web2.0 domain to a Diode Web3 Client Address](https://support.diode.io/article/6pctb40wj8)!

This enables any Web3 publisher to host content on a Web2.0 domain.  All 2, 3, and 4 letter [Top Level Domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) are supported.

Previous to this release, Web3 content could  be published only to other Web3 clients or via the https://<clientname>.diode.link Web2.0 subdomain.
