If you’re like me, you have a lot of devices.  I have my work computer, family laptop, family desktop, phone, tablet, as well as a few other devices.  Some of them should be retired by now, but I just can’t seem to let them go.  My wife has several devices too, as do my teenage kids.  I have tried different methods in the past to try and keep all my files organized, accessible, and shareable.  At one point I was taking a large USB drive to each computer to do manual backups.  It was a chore but at least I knew where all my files were.  Though there are options available online they usually come with their own challenges and limitations, the biggest one being file and storage size limits and, of course, the “IT support” that I have to give my family members to ensure they have access to, and are using, the online service.

Diode provides an elegant solution to these problems – it quietly synchronizes all my files to a single secure destination using full end to end encryption.

For my Diode setup I started out using a Raspberry Pi4 and a 1 Terabyte thumb drive as my “secure destination”.  With Diode installed, I set up a Zone for work, a Zone for family, and also setup a few personal Zones for files and folders I didn’t need to share access with other people.  Then, invited members to the zones: I invited my co-workers to my work Zone and my wife and kids to my family Zone.  My work Zone makes it easily for me to share any size files and to collaborate with co-workers.  I use my family Zone so that my wife and kids can access photos and other documents.  Even if none of our laptops or phones or other devices are open and running, the Pi is always on, ready to serve up files on demand.

With Diode I can finally access all my files from any device, all in one place!  Zones make it so easy to organize the files and the members who have access to them.  But perhaps most important, I have peace of mind knowing that even if something happens to my laptop, the files are always safely backed up in a safe location.
